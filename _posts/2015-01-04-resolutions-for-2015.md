title: Resolutions for 2015
---
I usually don't make one of these but then I thought: why not? It'll be fun to look back come this time next year. So here's a short list of New Year's Resolutions.

1.  Learn as much as I can from my Winter and subsequent Fall work terms.
2.  Work/live in a different city for my Fall work term or at least travel in the few precious days between each term.
3.  Find good books to read... If I remember correctly, the last time I had my nose in a book was last summer and that makes me sad.
4.  Work on at least a couple personal projects for fun (let's aim for 5).
5.  Don't be scared to blog about random stuff.
6.  Work on keeping in touch with old friends and leaving good first impressions on new friends.
7.  Learn a cool party trick.

It's a short list I know but I tried to exclude things like eat heathy, hit the gym, or sleep more (because that just isn't going to happen). Hopefully I complete/follow through on all my resolutions. Happy New Years to anyone and everyone who actually read this! :)
