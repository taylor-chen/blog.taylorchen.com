title: First Post

Someone once said, "the best time to start something is yesterday."

For me, and this blog, the best time to start was probably half a year ago when I first got the domain. I decided very early on that I will use this space as a timeline of sorts by blogging. Well that did not end up happening as I practically developed writer's block without even writing anything.

For anyone else that are have trouble starting something, start today and remember that everything has a beginning. Today I write my first post.
